## Feedback incorporated throughout the project:

### Feedback 1: 
How about add the cancel function to it so that to handle the situation that customers change their minds and go to another place.
How are you going to handle cancellations or no-shows after a customer has already reserved a table and order things off the menu? will they be held accountable in any way since their space would mostly be wasted?
#### Solution incorporated : 
We added cancel functionality to the waitlist portal.

### Feedback 2: 
Will there be a time limit regarding when you arrive vs when your table is ready? 
What happens if a user orders but then does not show up or cancels but the restaurant has made the food?
#### Solution incorporated : 
Restaurant owners can manage the waiting list online. They can cancel the reservation if the customer does not show up until a period of time. The length varies for each restaurant policy.

### Feedback 3  : 
How will the wait list data be updated? Will it depend on the restaurants? If restaurants have a busy wait list, will they want to spend the extra time to send these updates out to the servic
#### Solution incorporated : 
We only allow group size to be changed. 
If the restaurant is busy, the wait time will be high. When the customers enter and see that huge wait time they can login to their portal and delete their reservation.

Added pictures to the menu item
